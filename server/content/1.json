While most productive designing and writing backend systems, I am accomplished at leading cross functional teams and have extensive DevOps experience, especially with regards to CI/CD pipelines and containerisation. I also have reasonable frontend skills which include React, as demonstrated by the <a href='https://www.github.com/cressie176/www-app'>source code</a> for this site.</p><p>Until recently I was operating in a dual role, firstly as CTO and co-founder of <a href='https://www.guidesmiths.com'>GuideSmiths</a>, a successful Node.js & microservices consultancy, secondly as principal consultant, leading technical teams designing and implementing solutions for GuideSmith’s clients.<p></p>Due to a desire to spend more time with my family, I have negotiated an exit, and am seeking a senior, hands-on position in an agile or post agile environment, which can be predominantly carried out remotely or from the vicinity of my home in Suffolk.</p>"
