A popular strategy is to use a message broker, which in addition to providing the decoupling, can also add robustness and scalability. But messaging can be deceptively difficult. Which broker suits your needs best? Should you follow a \"command\" or \"event\" based model? How will you handle duplicates? Can you tolerate message loss? Will you recover from errors by discarding, retrying or dead lettering?</p>\n\n<p>If these questions weren't enough, you have to find a good client library. For RabbitMQ there's the excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node\">ampqlib</a>, but it's not for the faint of heart. Estabilishing a communication channel with the broker requires serveral api calls, and will not be automatically be restablished if dropped. Messages are not persistent or confirmed by default. Errors are likely to crash your application, and there's no support for clustering.</p>\n\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.github.com/guidesmiths/rascal\">Rascal</a>, a friendly, config driven RabbitMQ client which sits on top of amqplib, simplyfing adoption significantly.</p>",

Jasmine, Mocha and Vows, are excellent test frameworks, but from a BDD perspective they merely describe('some test function') with text. Chai and Expect don't even do this, they are fluid assertion apis, which attempt to simulate an ordinary language a.bit.like.this().</p>\n\n<p>The only true BDD tool found for JavaScript is CucumberJS. The problem with CucumberJS is that the Gerkin syntax is restrictive. I don't want to be limited to starting my sentences with \"Given\", \"When\", \"Then\", \"And\" and \"But\". I want to express myself naturally.</p>\n\n<p>I also want a test runner that makes good decisions about which steps to run, that works in a browser and that lets me plugin different step libraries so that I can test multiple interfaces (e.g. rest and HTML) with the same scenarios. I even want a tool that has nothing to do with testing and just maps ordinary sentences to functions so I could use it in a rules engine or build script.</p>\n\n<p>That's why I wrote <a href=\\'http://www.github.com/acuminous/yadda\\'>Yadda</a> - the other JavaScript BDD library.</p>",

Jasmine, Mocha and Vows, are excellent test frameworks, but from a BDD perspective they merely describe('some test function') with text. Chai and Expect don't even do this, they are fluid assertion apis, which attempt to simulate an ordinary language a.bit.like.this().</p>\n\n<p>The only true BDD tool found for JavaScript is CucumberJS. The problem with CucumberJS is that the Gerkin syntax is restrictive. I don't want to be limited to starting my sentences with \"Given\", \"When\", \"Then\", \"And\" and \"But\". I want to express myself naturally.</p>\n\n<p>I also want a test runner that makes good decisions about which steps to run, that works in a browser and that lets me plugin different step libraries so that I can test multiple interfaces (e.g. rest and HTML) with the same scenarios. I even want a tool that has nothing to do with testing and just maps ordinary sentences to functions so I could use it in a rules engine or build script.</p>\n\n<p>That's why I wrote <a href=\\'http://www.github.com/acuminous/yadda\\'>Yadda</a> - the other JavaScript BDD library.</p>",

Chai and Expect don't even do this, they are fluid assertion apis, which attempt to simulate an ordinary language a.bit.like.this().</p>\n\n<p>The only true BDD tool found for JavaScript is CucumberJS. The problem with CucumberJS is that the Gerkin syntax is restrictive. I don't want to be limited to starting my sentences with \"Given\", \"When\", \"Then\", \"And\" and \"But\". I want to express myself naturally.</p>\n\n<p>I also want a test runner that makes good decisions about which steps to run, that works in a browser and that lets me plugin different step libraries so that I can test multiple interfaces (e.g. rest and HTML) with the same scenarios. I even want a tool that has nothing to do with testing and just maps ordinary sentences to functions so I could use it in a rules engine or build script.</p>\n\n<p>That's why I wrote <a href=\\'http://www.github.com/acuminous/yadda\\'>Yadda</a> - the other JavaScript BDD library.</p>",
